README for Drilling Optimisation Notebook
This repository contains the notebook Drilling optimisation.ipynb, which focuses on optimizing drilling performance metrics using advanced machine learning models. The notebook employs regression techniques to predict the rate of penetration (ROP) based on operational parameters from the dataset Time Interval Data Drilling.csv.

Dataset Overview
	•	Dataset Name: Time Interval Data Drilling.csv
	•	Key Features:
	•	Weight on Bit
	•	Top Drive RPM
	•	Top Drive Torque (ft-lbs)
	•	Flow In
	•	Pump Pressure
	•	SPM Total
	•	Bit RPM
	•	Depth Hole TVD
	•	Differential Pressure
	•	Downhole Torque
	•	MUD TEMP
	•	Target Variable: ROP Depth/Hour

Code contains
	1.	Data Preprocessing:
	•	Loading and cleaning the dataset.
	•	Handling missing values (Time column).
	•	Converting the Time column to a datetime format.
	2.	Feature Engineering:
	•	A new feature Torque_Flow was created by multiplying Top Drive Torque (ft-lbs) and Flow In to capture their combined impact on ROP.
	3.	Machine Learning Models:
	•	Random Forest Regressor
	•	XGBoost Regressor
	•	Stacking Regressor (ensemble model combining Random Forest and XGBoost)
	4.	SHAP Analysis:
	•	Used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret model predictions and understand feature importance.
	5.	Evaluation Metrics:
	•	Mean Squared Error (MSE)
	•	￼ Score
	6.	Visualizations:
	•	Residual analysis for Random Forest.
	•	SHAP summary and dependence plots for feature interpretability.

Steps taken
	1.	Modeling Enhancements:
	•	Implemented ensemble learning using Stacking Regressor to improve predictive accuracy.
	•	Conducted hyperparameter tuning for Random Forest and XGBoost models.
	2.	Feature Engineering:
	•	Created a derived feature (Torque_Flow) to capture non-linear interactions.
	•	Identified key features using SHAP analysis.
	3.	Interpretability:
	•	Applied SHAP to generate insights on feature contributions to ROP predictions.
	•	Visualized the dependence of key features like Depth Hole TVD on model predictions.
	4.	Performance Improvement:
	•	Compared the performance of Random Forest, XGBoost, and the ensemble model.
	•	Demonstrated improved accuracy with the ensemble model.

Model Improvement
	1.	Feature Engineering:
	•	Added a meaningful derived feature to enhance model understanding of interactions.
	2.	Model Interpretability:
	•	Used SHAP to provide a transparent view of model decisions, helping identify critical factors affecting ROP.
